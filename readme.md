# Calendar App

This is a React-based Calendar App that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete events. The app displays events on a calendar and provides features to navigate between months. The events are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Events**: Add new events with a title, date, time, and description.
- **View Events**: View events directly on the calendar with a quick view of the title.
- **Edit Events**: Edit existing events with ease.
- **Delete Events**: Remove events from the calendar.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
